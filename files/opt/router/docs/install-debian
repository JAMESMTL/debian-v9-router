INSTALL DEBIAN

1. download debian stretch here:
https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso

If you are NOT installing to a VM you will need to create a boot device.
See rufus https://rufus.ie/

if you are installing as a VM I suggest the following specs

	2 vCPU (or more) - 2 core 1 socket
	2-4 GB Memory
	16 GB HD (thin)
	NIC #1 (WAN) assign mac 00:50:56:00:01:01 (WAN)
	NIC #2 (LAN) assign mac 00:50:56:00:01:02 (LAN)
 
If you are not using esxi or do not assign the above mac addresses, you
will have to edit the udev persistent net rules after install.
 
2. Install debian

select defaults for most except:

a) DO A REGULAR TEXT INSTALL AND NOT A GRAPHICAL INSTALL
b) configure the network: Chose the your lan interface
c) configure the network: chose your router's unique hostname
d) configure the network: leave domain name blank
e) set up users and passwords: set root password
f) set up users and passwords: create user account and set password 
   - I will refer to this account as the build account
   - you will only log in initially with this account until root is unlocked over ssh
g) partition disks: write changes to disk yes
h) software selection:  only select ssh server + standard system utilities. disable everything else
i) Install the GRUB boot on a hard disk: select drive probably /dev/sda

done!
