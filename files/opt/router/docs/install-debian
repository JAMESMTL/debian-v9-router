INSTALL DEBIAN

1. download debian stretch here:
https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.8.0-amd64-netinst.iso

If you are NOT installing to a VM you will need to create a boot device.
See rufus https://rufus.ie/

if you are installing as a VM I suggest the following specs

	2 vCPU (min) - 2 core 1 socket
	2-4 GB Memory
	16 GB HD (thin)
	NIC #1 (WAN) assign mac 00:50:56:00:01:01 (WAN)
	NIC #2 (LAN) assign mac 00:50:56:00:01:02 (LAN)
 
If you are not using esxi or do not assign the above mac addresses, you
will have to edit the udev persistent net rules after install.
 
3. Install debian [TIME < 5 minutes]

DO A REGULAR TEXT INSTALL AND NOT A GRAPHICAL INSTALL

select defaults for most except

a) during install configure the network using second NIC (possibly ens224)
b) hostname whatever
c) domain name blank
d) new user whatever (i use build and will call user account the build account).
   you will only log in initially with this account until root is unlocked over ssh
e) software selection (only select ssh server + standard system utilities. disable everything else)
f) bootloader probably /dev/sda
